# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Neural Network Charity Analysis program uses Deep Learning Models to analyze over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from business team will be successful. We use dataset features and target to help foundation predict the company's investment. Our goal is to optimize the Neural Network Deep Learning Model to achieve a target predictive accuracy more than 75%. 

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing
- Target: 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' that predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup Business.
- Features: 'NAME','APPLICATION_TYPE','AFFILIATION','CLASSIFICATION','USE_CASE','ORGANIZATION','INCOME_AMT'
- Neither Targets nor Features: 'EIN','STATUS','SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS' -(will be removed for data analysis)

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

#### Resources:
Explaination for each columns that capture metadata:
  - EIN and NAME — Identification columns
  - APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
  - AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
  - CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
  - USE_CASE — Use case for funding
  - ORGANIZATION — Organization type
  - STATUS — Active status
  - INCOME_AMT — Income classification
  - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special consideration for application
  - ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
  - IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
